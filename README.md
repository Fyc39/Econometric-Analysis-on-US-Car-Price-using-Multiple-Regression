# Econometric-Analysis-on-US-Car-Price
U.S. car auction prices are intricately shaped by a multifaceted interplay of factors encompassing market dynamics, consumer preferences, vehicle conditions, and the efficacy of the auction process. A comprehensive understanding of these factors is imperative for both buyers and sellers navigating the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of car auctions in the United States. Therefore, in this project, we have aimed to implement a multi-linear regression model to observe the factors, such as mileage, model, year, and region versus the price of a car. 

Approach:
Data Collection: Collected data from www.auctionexport.com. 
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Multiple Regression Analysis: Implemented multiple regression models using R to quantify the impact of independent variables on car prices.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the regression models using appropriate metrics and techniques.

Technologies Used:
R Programming Language
R Studio (Integrated Development Environment)
